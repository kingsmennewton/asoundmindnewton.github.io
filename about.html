							according to doctors, untreated mental illness can contribute to higher medical
							expenses, poorer performance at school and work, and increased risk of suicide.

							It's quite rampant these days; mental illnesses, and yet, you don't find it very

							shrugged off as if it's nothing, not knowing it's everything. One wrong move and the
							victim falls, but most don't even bother to bat an eye on the issue. Unquestionably,
							this generation is more exposed to mental sickness, considering most common factors:
							stress, peer pressure, and fear itself which are growing rapidly in this modern society.

							As high school students, we aim to pay more attention to raising mental health awareness amongst our peers. Among all people,
							studies say teenagers have the most unstable minds. The way they think is easily influenced by what they see and experience
							around them. They can also be easily deceived by their own expectations which causes depression and other mental issues. Our
							advocacy is to help these young people achieve<font face='Montserrat' color='dfb81c' size='3'><b> A Sound Mind</b></font> and
							fight against mental illnesses despite all the problems that they may encounter.

<br>						
<br>
							Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. 
							It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having 
							this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, 
							family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint. Simply the thought 
							of getting through the day provokes anxiety (Grohol, 2019).

							<b><font face='Montserrat' color='ffffff' size='5'>DEPRESSION</font></b>
<br>						
<br>
							Clinical depression goes by many names, such as “the blues,” biological or clinical depression,
							and a major depressive episode. But all of these names refer to the same thing: feeling sad and
							depressed for weeks or months on end — not just a passing blue mood of a day or two. This feeling 
							is most often accompanied by a sense of hopelessness, a lack of energy (or feeling “weighed down”),
							and taking little or no pleasure in things that once gave a person joy in the past (Grohol, 2019).

							<b><font face='Montserrat' color='ffffff' size='5'>SUPERIORITY COMPLEX</font></b>
<br>						
<br>
							Those exhibiting the superiority complex have a self-image of supremacy. Those with superiority
							complexes may garner a negative image in those around them, as they are not concerned with the opinions
							of others about themselves. Superiority complex sufferers do not always care about image or vanity, since
							they have innate feelings of superiority and thus do not usually concern themselves with proving their
							superiority to others. The term "superiority complex", in everyday usage, refers to an overly high opinion
							of oneself. In psychology, it refers not to a belief, but a pattern of behaviors expressing the belief
							that one is superior.

<br>						
<br>
							At the onset of stuttering, the speaker may not be aware of the problem, although awareness and even fearful
							anticipation of the problem may develop later. The speaker may attempt to avoid stuttering by linguistic mechanisms
							(e.g., altering the rate of speech, avoiding certain speech situations such as telephoning or public speaking, or
							avoiding certain words or sounds). Stuttering may be accompanied by motor movements (e.g., eye blinks, tics, tremors
							of the lips or face, jerking of the head, breathing movements, or fist clenching) (Grohol, 2019).

							<b><font face='Montserrat' color='ffffff' size='5'>SELECTIVE MUTISM</font></b>
<br>						
<br>
							Selective mutism is a type of anxiety disorder whose main distinguishing characteristic is the persistent failure to
							speak in specific social situations (e.g., at school or with playmates) where speaking is expected, despite speaking
							in other situations. Selective mutism should not be diagnosed if the individual’s failure to speak is due solely to a
							lack of knowledge of, or comfort with, the spoken language required in the social situation. It is also not diagnosed
							if the disturbance is accounted for by embarrassment related to having a communication disorder (e.g., stuttering) or
							if it occurs exclusively during a pervasive developmental disorder, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorder
							(Grohol, 2019).

<br>						
<br>
							An inferiority complex consists of lack of self-esteem, a doubt and uncertainty about oneself, and feelings of not
							measuring up to standards. It is often subconscious, and is thought to drive afflicted individuals to overcompensate,
							resulting either in spectacular achievement or extremely asocial behavior. An inferiority complex occurs when the feelings
							of inferiority are intensified in the individual through discouragement or failure. Those who are at risk for developing a
							complex include people who: show signs of low self-esteem or self-worth, have low socioeconomic status, or have a history
							of depression symptoms.
